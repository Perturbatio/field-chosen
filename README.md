## Description

This is a wordpress plugin which provides a select field enhanced by the jQuery chosen library for

e.g.

1. Upload the plugin to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. The `chosen` field type will now be available to use

## Usage

This is a drop-in replacement for the `select` field type, it has all the same requirements, the only difference is
